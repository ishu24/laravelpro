<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who We Are</span></strong>: We are Irv Cernauskas and Shelly Herman. We have raised our kids Miles and Lia here in the Midwest, cooking and eating the bounty of our hard working farmer friends. We are passionate about good food and good health, both for our own family and all communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">When we met at MIT pursuing our MBAs, we envisioned using our new business skills for social good&mdash;healthier people, healthier communities, a healthier planet. Shelly went off to work in community economic development for 20 years investing in underserved areas. Irv became involved in nonprofit environmental activities and creating markets for local farmers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why We Started Fresh Picks</span></strong>: Our farmer friends work hard to grow good food; food with no chemicals, no hormones, no antibiotics, no GMOs. They wanted to spend more time farming and less time marketing, packing and trucking their food. We also realized that people needed an easier way to get this fresh healthy food in a convenient year-round way. So we started Irv &amp; Shelly's Fresh Picks<sup>(R)</sup> to grow a better food system, one that supports our small independent farmers and feeds all of us.</span></p>	</div>
