<h2 id="help1">Sign Up</h2>
<p><a title="signup_01" name="signup_01"></a><strong>How do I sign up?</strong>&nbsp;<br />If you are a first time customer, be sure to check that we deliver to you by entering your zip code in the &ldquo;New to Fresh Picks&rdquo; box at the left side of each page. Signing up for your account is easy! Just click &ldquo;Register&rdquo; at the top of any page to create a password and begin shopping.</p>
<p><a title="signup_02" name="signup_02"></a><strong>When will I get my first order?</strong>&nbsp;<br />You will receive your first delivery on the date specified during Order Review on the Check Out Page. This date will also be listed in your confirmation email. As long as you place your order before the order deadline (10 am the day before the delivery day for your zip code) you can receive an order during the same week you opened your account.</p>
<h2 id="help2"><br />Ordering</h2>
<p><a title="ordering_01" name="ordering_01"></a><strong>How do I order?</strong>&nbsp;<br /><strong></strong><em>It&rsquo;s so easy!</em>&nbsp; Browse through our grocery aisles by clicking on the &ldquo;Start Picking&rdquo; tab on the left side of the screen.&nbsp; You can also search by specific items or brands through the search feature. Build your grocery cart by choosing the products and quantities you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="ordering_02" name="ordering_02"></a><strong>When must I make my order?</strong>&nbsp;<br />You need to place your order by&nbsp;10 am&nbsp;the day before you will receive delivery. If your delivery day is Wednesday, then this means placing your order by Tuesday 10 am</p>
<p><strong>How is my order confirmed?</strong> <br />You will receive a confirmation email within a few minutes of placing your order. Please put our email <a href="mailto:answers@freshpicks.com">answers@freshpicks.com</a> in your address book so our email does not go into your spam folder. For Recurring Orders, you will&nbsp;receive a reminder email the&nbsp;week before the order deadline in case you want to make any changes.</p>
<p><strong>Why did I get multiple confirmation emails for one order?</strong> <br />Anytime you make changes to a current order you will receive another confirmation email. This is sent out to confirm the changes you have made. The last confirmation email you receive does consist of the entire order we have in our system.</p>
<p><a title="ordering_04" name="ordering_05"></a><strong>Can I customize my order?</strong>&nbsp;<br /><em>Yes! </em>You can order based on your unique needs with no requirement to include one of our weekly Fresh Picks boxes with your order. There is no commitment to ordering, no money up front, no order minimum and no membership fee. You can order what you want, when you want it.</p>
<p><a title="ordering_04" name="ordering_06"></a><strong>What is a recurring order?</strong> <br />You can set up a recurring order that will automatically reoccur every week or every other week. It&rsquo;s a great way to ensure you never run out of your grocery staples. You can easily adjust your order based on what you need that week making the recurring order just as flexible as one-time orders<em>.</em> You can cancel, suspend or adjust your orders at any time.</p>
<p>You will see the &ldquo;Add to Recurring Order&rdquo; choice for every product.&nbsp; Once you have chosen the products for your Recurring Order, you choose the frequency and start date and you are all set!</p>
<p><a title="ordering_04" name="ordering_07"></a><strong>Must I order weekly or bi-weekly?</strong>&nbsp;<br />No. You can order whenever you want. Once a week, once a month. Whatever works for you! You can also schedule items to receive&nbsp;on a recurring weekly or bi-weekly basis as described above.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><strong><a title="ordering_04" name="ordering_08"></a><strong></strong>What if I am going away?</strong>&nbsp;<br />If you are going away on vacation, good for you! If you have a Recurring Order you can put your orders on hold and choose the date for your orders to resume. If you placed a one-time order you now want to cancel, click on your Cart and then click Cancel This Order.<br /><br /><a title="ordering_05" name="ordering_09"></a><strong>Do you offer wholesale pricing?</strong><br />Yes. We offer special case prices for larger volume customers like restaurants, schools and other businesses. To inquire about case pricing email us at <a href="mailto:answers@freshpicks.com">answers@freshpicks.com</a>.</p>
<p><a title="ordering_06" name="ordering_10"></a><strong>Why does my order status say complete but I have not received my order?</strong> <br />Your order status will show as complete once your order is put on the truck and is on its way. Please feel free to contact us to find out what the timing looks like for that day.</p>
<h2 id="help3"><br />Payment</h2>
<p><a title="ordering_05" name="payment_01"></a><strong>How does payment work?</strong><br />We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. Once you check out a preauthorization will be sent to your bank. Your statement will show a charge from us as &ldquo;processing.&rdquo; We will finalize the charge on the morning of your delivery. Your final total will be adjusted for the actual weight on certain meats and for any item that is out-of-stock.</p>
<p><a title="ordering_06" name="payment_02"></a><strong>How do you ensure my payment is secure?</strong> <br />The security of your financial information is very important to us. Your card information is encrypted to be protected from any disclosure and our website is secure using an SSL Certificate.</p>
<h2 id="help4"><br />Our Products</h2>
<p><a title="products_01" name="products_01"></a><strong>What products do you carry?&nbsp;</strong><br />At Fresh Picks we carry an abundant choice of local and organic fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy, eggs, baked goods and grocery items. We supplement local seasonal items with foods from our certified organic partners in other regions, including items like oranges and avocados that are not available locally any time of year.</p>
<p><a title="products_02" name="products_02"></a><strong>What is a Fresh Picks Box? </strong><br />The Fresh Picks Boxes are filled with the best local and seasonal produce from dozens of local farms. We do supplement with produce grown outside the region during the winter months to maintain some variety. All of the contents of our Fresh Picks boxes are chosen by us but can be customized based on your individual preferences. Just list any items you want to exclude on your Account Dashboard.</p>
<p>We offer Vegetable Boxes, Fruit boxes, Fruit and Vegetable Boxes, Juicing Boxes, Cleanse Boxes and Recipe Special Boxes. &nbsp;We also offer a variety of seasonal kits. These boxes come in a variety of sizes to fit every budget with smaller sizes starting at $15.</p>
<p>We will occasionally include non-produce items (like prepared foods, eggs, baked goods, etc) during the winter to continue to support our local farmers even when they&rsquo;re not growing. Be sure to list any dietary restrictions in your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the boxes that we carry year round we also have a featured Fresh Picks Box each month. In contrast to our regular boxes the contents of this box remain the same throughout the month. Some past examples include the Green Machine Box, the Raw Box and the Rainbow Box. We partner with nutritionists and other healthy food professionals to design these boxes to offer the healthiest and most fun seasonal items.</p>
<p>The Fresh Picks Boxes offer a great value as you get about 10% more in the box than you would if you ordered all of the items individually.</p>
<p><strong><a title="products_02" name="products_03"></a><strong></strong>How can I customize a Fresh Picks Box? </strong><br />Even though we do choose the items that are in our boxes you can customize them by excluding certain items. If there are things you are allergic to or just don&rsquo;t like, list them on your Account Dashboard. If we have these items in your box we will leave them out and substitute other items in.</p>
<p><strong><a title="products_02" name="products_04"></a><strong></strong>Can I order by recipe? </strong><br />Of course! We have a comprehensive collection of healthy recipes that you can browse by clicking on &ldquo;Recipes&rdquo; at the left of each page. Once you find a recipe that you like, ordering the items you need is a breeze! Each ingredient is listed on the recipe page so all you have to do is add it to your cart.</p>
<p><a title="products_03" name="products_05"></a><strong>Where does your food come from?&nbsp;</strong><br />Our food comes from dozens of local sustainable farms we personally know and trust in the Midwest. We supplement local seasonal items with foods from our certified organic partners in other regions. <br /><br /><strong><a title="products_03" name="products_06"></a><strong></strong>Are all of your products certified organic? </strong><br />No, not all of our local products are certified organic. Many of our local farmers are not certified organic but they do grow organically with no use of hormones, antibiotics, pesticides or GMO&rsquo;s. Other local products contain the best combination of local and organic ingredients we can find and are labeled accordingly. All products we source from outside the region are certified organic.</p>
<p><strong><a title="products_03" name="products_07"></a><strong></strong>What if I am not satisfied with an item in my order?&nbsp;</strong><br />We offer 100% satisfaction guaranteed. If you are not satisfied with anything in your order please contact us and we will issue a credit back to your card or a replacement. It&rsquo;s that simple. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="help5">Delivery</h2>
<p><a title="delivery_01" name="delivery_01"></a><strong>Where do you deliver?</strong> <br />Fresh Picks delivers in Chicago, Milwaukee, Kenosha, Racine and many surrounding suburbs. Check the &ldquo;New to Fresh Picks&rdquo; box at the right of every page to see if we deliver to you.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><a title="delivery_02" name="delivery_02"></a><strong>When do you make your deliveries?</strong><br />In order to make our routes as efficient as possible and cut down on our carbon emissions, we are only in certain areas on certain days. Your shipping zip code will dictate your delivery day. Most of our deliveries are made between 9 AM and 6 PM. We do not schedule specific delivery times for our customers. If you have timing concerns please feel free to contact us. We are able to schedule deliveries to business locations before 5 pm. If you would like to get a smaller window of when your delivery should arrive please contact us the day of or day before your delivery.</p>
<p><a title="delivery_03" name="delivery_03"></a><strong>Must I be home to receive my order?</strong><br />You do not need to be home to accept delivery. All of our orders are packed in insulated Fresh Picks Bins with ice packs to keep everything nice and cool. We just need to have a secure location to leave your order if you are not home. You need to designate this location in the unattended delivery instructions on your Account Dashboard<em>.</em> Common locations include porches, mail rooms, door staff, lobbies or even friendly neighborhood businesses.</p>
<p>To help facilitate delivery we also accept keys to public areas (not into individual apartments) so we can bring the order directly into your building. If you would like to send a key please email us and send it in a padded mailer along with your account number. Do not include your return address for security purposes.</p>
<p><a title="delivery_05" name="delivery_04"></a><strong>Can I pick up an order and save myself the delivery fee?</strong> <br />Yes, you may pick up your orders from our warehouse (5627 W Howard St Niles, IL 60714) any day Tuesday through Saturday. Please contact us so we can help you get your account set up for pick up.</p>
<p><a title="delivery_04" name="delivery_05"></a><strong>How do you deliver my order to keep it fresh?</strong><br />Your order will be delivered in our Fresh Picks bins. Our reusable bins will be packed with materials such as ice packs and&nbsp;insulating inserts to keep your order fresh for up to 8 hours either in the heat of the summer or the cold of winter. We pick up the bins and packing materials when we deliver your next order and charge a $30 replacement fee if the items are not returned.</p>
<p>If you find that storing the bin each week is less than ideal please feel free to contact us. We are happy to pack your orders in wax cartons instead of our Fresh Picks bins. These cartons can be broken down and reused in any way that you feel fit as there&rsquo;s no need to return them.<br /><br /><a title="delivery_05" name="delivery_06"></a><strong>How do I return the bins to&nbsp; you if I won't be ordering for a few weeks?</strong> <br />Please contact us and we will schedule a bin pick up. Usually this is the next time we are delivering in your area. We ask that you leave the bins in your specified unattended delivery location that morning so our driver can easily find them. There is no charge for a pick up.</p>
<p><a title="delivery_05" name="delivery_07"></a><strong>What is the fee for delivery?</strong> <br />There is currently $5.50 for shipping and handling on all orders with a $1 fuel surcharge. Tips for our friendly drivers &amp; staff are always appreciated but never expected.</p>
